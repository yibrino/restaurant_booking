# Technology Overview

## Visual Studio
Visual Studio is a robust development environment I employed for writing, reviewing, integrating, and deploying code.

## GitHub
GitHub is a platform for version control and collaborative software development. I utilized it to create a central code repository and manage the deployment of Restaurant No1. This tool allows me to track changes made to the code and revert to previous versions when necessary.

## Heroku
Heroku is a cloud-based platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and scale modern applications seamlessly. Supporting multiple programming languages including Node.js, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, and Clojure, Heroku allows developers to focus on code rather than infrastructure. I deployed Restaurant No1 on Heroku, taking advantage of its seamless integration with GitHub.

## Django & Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Django, a free and open-source Python-based web framework, follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern. I utilized Django and Python to develop the core functionalities of Restaurant No1.

Google Fonts enhance the visual appeal of websites. I incorporated Google fonts in Restaurant No1: "Roboto/sans-serif".

## W3C HTML & CSS Validators
The W3C provides online tools to validate HTML and CSS code by URL, file upload, or direct input. I used these validators to ensure the HTML and CSS code of Restaurant No1 adhered to web standards.

## CI Python Linter
The CI Python Linter, an online tool provided by Code Institute, was used to validate all Python files of Restaurant No1 through direct code input.

## JSHint
JSHint is an online tool for validating JavaScript code. I used JSHint to ensure the JavaScript code in Restaurant No1 was error-free and followed best practices.

## Balsamiq Wireframes
Balsamiq Wireframes is a graphical user interface wireframe builder application. It allows designers to arrange pre-built widgets using a drag-and-drop editor. I utilized Balsamiq to create wireframes for Restaurant No1.

## Lucidchart
Lucidchart is a web-based diagramming application that facilitates collaborative drawing, revising, and sharing of charts and diagrams. I used it to create the entity relationship diagram for Restaurant No1.

## Pexels
Pexels.com is a platform that provides high-quality and completely free stock photos licensed under the Pexels license. I used Pexels.com to source and manage visual content for Restaurant No1.

## ElephantSQL
ElephantSQL is a PostgreSQL database hosting service that manages administrative tasks such as installation, upgrades, and backups. I utilized ElephantSQL to host the PostgreSQL database for Restaurant No1.
